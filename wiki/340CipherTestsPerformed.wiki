#summary Please post all tests that have been conducted on the 340 cipher here.

= Introduction =

The current cipher decryption engine works well on character substitution ciphers,
but does NOT work on transposition ciphers.  So, rearranging the cipher, saving it
to another text file and running it through the decryption engine should solve the
cipher if the transposition was done correctly.  Please describe your 'routing' of
the transposition similar to what is shown below.

= Details =

Test #1

Routing - This attempt involved moving the 9th column to the 1st column.

Please download the rearranged file from the download section.

#summary Please post all tests that have been conducted on the 340 cipher here.

= Introduction =

The current cipher decryption engine works well on character substitution ciphers,
but does NOT work on transposition ciphers.  So, rearranging the cipher, saving it
to another text file and running it through the decryption engine should solve the
cipher if the transposition was done correctly.

Test #1
